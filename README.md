# Applied Machine Learning @ Scale
## _Let's build a recommender system

This repository contains code for a recommender system for the MovieLens dataset. We implemented the Matrix Factorization technique with the Alternating Least Squares algorithm. To run the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Timebudget
- Tqdm
- Pandas

## Installation
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the code by following these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git@github.com:AurelAgbodoyetin/applied-ml.git
```
Navigate to the directory containing the code:
```sh
cd applied-ml/
```
Install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Train the model:
```sh
python main.py
```

Done you've just trained you amazing recommender !! ✅  ✨
